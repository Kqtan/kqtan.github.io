## About Me

I am an Actuarial Science graduate currently working as a **Data Scientist**, alongside analytics to deliver business insights. Passionate about fintech, I aim to transition into an Artificial Intelligence-related job, focusing on backend development and stakeholder-driven analyses. With expertise in business analytics, statistical modelling, and machine learning, I thrive in a technical-driven and agile environment. Eager to learn and grow, I am ready to apply my business acumen and analytical mindset to create value and make an impact. I am actively looking for the right opportunity to prove my potential and contribute to the fast-paced industry.

## Job Experience

### Sun Life Malaysia - Strategic Analytics Intern (Oct 2022 - Jan 2023)
- I was assigned to the development of the internal-use super apps. Throughout the internship, I worked on the campaign management module, which incorporates the lights of AI. The notion of the module is to allow employees to organise campaigns with a more consistent approach. As the platform collects more data from the users, it is expected that the module could automatically generate the desired campaigns according to the user.

### Informa Markets Malaysia - Database assistant (Jan 2019 - May 2019)
- I worked under the database and registration committee for the annual B2B event, MIFF. The event has participants from more than 130 countries and regions around the globe, and I am assigned to handle the registrations alongside with other colleagues. After the event, I led the data entry team to digitalise more than 10,000 new customers into the database alongside the data processing work to ensure that the data was accurate.
